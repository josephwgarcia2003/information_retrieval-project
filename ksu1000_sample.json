Student Success Possessing computer skills and feeling comfortable online does not necessarily ensure\n                                    your success in an online course. A common theme in online courses is self-discipline\n                                    and persistence. At Kennesaw State, we are committed to helping our online students\n                                    achieving their academic best. Online Student Success Frequently Asked Questions What are the benefits of online learning? Online learning provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities. Save time and money spent commuting to a campus Continue working at your current job while you are taking classes Attend your class from anywhere as long as you have a high-speed Internet connection Learn at your own pace and study at your convenience Learn new technologies Interact on equal footing Students will have the same kinds of deadlines and structured responsibilities of\n                                                   a face-to-face class. In other words, flexibility must be balanced by responsibility.\n                                                   Like a face-to-face course, online courses require assignments be completed by due\n                                                   dates, your attendance (via logins to your course), involvement in online discussions,\n                                                   and sometimes group collaboration. Most students enjoy the active learning that online\n                                                   classes involve. What are the challenges of online learning? Self-motivation and discipline are required to succeed in distance learning courses.\n                                                   For many, distance learning offers access to education not previously available. It\n                                                   also provides a solution to flexibility needs, work and travel responsibilities, and\n                                                   family challenges. A successful experience in distance learning requires a basic familiarity with technology. Resources are available for students through University Information Technology Services for those interested in distance learning, but in need of a technology refresher. It is also strongly recommended that students have ready access to a computer or laptop with a high-speed Internet access, such as DSL or cable broadband. Online courses will require students to download and access course materials. Online learning success depends on preparation, motivation, dedication, and planning. What equipment and technology will I need to be successful at online learning? Online learners will need a computer, Internet access, basic software (such as Microsoft\n                                                   Office Suite, Windows Media Player, Quicktime movie player, anti-virus protection\n                                                   and a compatible browser), and auxiliary equipment (such as a webcam and microphone\n                                                   headset for video-based communication). Of course, technology needs will vary by course.\n                                                   But this list applies to the majority of courses. Computer: Online Learners will need reliable access to a desktop or laptop computer that has\n                                                      adequate memory and processing capabilities for large file downloads, video players,\n                                                      and synchronous meeting applications. Auxiliary Equipment: The Digital Learning Innovations team also strongly recommends a WebCam and Headset\n                                                      for video-based communication. Many newer laptop or monitor set-ups are pre-equipped.\n                                                      These items may be required by faculty on a course-by-course basis. Internet Access: Online courses at KSU use the web to deliver courses at a distance. So, to learn\n                                                      in an online course smoothly, you need a high-speed Internet connection (such as DSL,\n                                                      Broadband, etc). This is especially important to the online learning experience. Software: While this will vary by course, you will need a recent version of the Microsoft Office\n                                                      Suite. Access to MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS Excel are expected and necessary for\n                                                      viewing course material or completing assignments. Additional requirements include\n                                                      anti-virus protection, Windows Media Player, QuickTime movie player, and a compatible\n                                                      browser. Visit UITS Training for additional information on software training, compatibility,\n                                                      and available downloads. HAVE MORE QUESTIONS?

How are students notified in case of an emergency? Kennesaw State University has developed a robust, multi-layered approach to emergency\n                                                notification.

The Know More, Borrow Less (KMBL) initiative supports the USG\u2019s three primary objectives: graduate more students, be more affordable and be more efficient. This initiative is designed to reduce barriers to aid, improve students\u2019 understanding of borrowing and reduce student debt. To support this initiative, a \u201cdebt letter\u201d will be electronically sent in a mobile-friendly format to every enrolled student who currently has student loan debt resulting from federal or state loan programs, or private lender borrowing. Students will receive both a text and an email providing them a link to a personalized letter containing specific information on monthly payments based on their current loan amounts. Each academic year, students will receive a debt letter, updating them on their cumulative student loan debt. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will have analytics to review the open rate of these messages to ensure students are receiving the information.

Cybersecurity Degree Student Journeys Asher Andree, BS in Cybersecurity Class of 2019 Kennesaw State University\u2019s Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity program has greatly contributed to my growth both professionally and personally. After graduation, I was able to join a young and rapidly-growing cybersecurity firm in the Atlanta area, which allowed me to quickly jump into the world of consulting. This was all thanks to connections I formed during my time at KSU. I've since been able to grow into a full-time career as a penetration tester and red teamer, helping organizations secure their critical assets and helping to reduce business risk. My experiences from the CYBR program have been extremely valuable during this entire process. The technical and managerial concepts taught in the courses aided me in multiple real-world settings and projects. Additionally, I\u2019d argue that the extracurricular opportunities at KSU, such as the Offensive Security club and SECCDC competition, are key differentiators for the program, and are nearly equal to the value of an entire undergraduate degree in themselves. If you are local to the Atlanta area, it\u2019s also worth noting the extremely advantageous location that KSU possesses. The Atlanta technology sector is growing rapidly, with many large organizations in the city seeking talented individuals from universities like KSU. Madison Loewe, BS in Cybersecurity Class of 2021 Kennesaw State University alumna Madison Loewe graduated summa cum laude in Spring\n                                    2021. For her graduating class, she was recognized as the Cybersecurity Student of\n                                    the Year. This honor had been noticed by Risk3sixty, and they reached out to Loewe\n                                    about an interview. While going through the interview process, she noticed that she\n                                    enjoyed talking to the team and reading their content online and determined that this\n                                    was the place for her. Soon after, Loewe was an Associate at Risk3sixty and worked\n                                    within the GRC space with their SOC 2 team. The material she had learned throughout\n                                    her college journey had been integral to understanding the work she would be doing\n                                    and preparing her to face the challenges of cybersecurity. In her role, she is continuously\n                                    learning and growing as she interacts with many aspects of the cybersecurity field,\n                                    from configurations to vendor management to penetration test reports, with many different\n                                    business models. By April of 2022, she had been promoted to Senior Associate. Since\n                                    then, Loewe has published content related to the SOC 2 attestation process, begun\n                                    participating in a book club for professional development, and been studying for certifications.

Having earned an education specialist degree, it marked her third successful round in higher education, to strengthen her skillset as a history teacher. In the crowd were her daughter, Mima Hrnjak, a nursing student in Kennesaw State\u2019s Wellstar College of Health and Human Services , and Ray\u2019s parents. They made the trip from their native Serbia, known as Yugoslavia when Ray migrated to the states in the \u201990s as a 16-year-old basketball player. \u201cI've always looked up to my mom,\u201d Hrnjak said. \u201cShe has taught my sister and I that you can do anything, and if it's hard, that means it's worth doing.\u201d Ray\u2019s first dream was to become a professional athlete, and she started strong as a member of Yugoslavia\u2019s junior national team. However, life had other plans \u2014 a successful career as an educator. In addition to earning status as a Bagwell Scholar as a student, she was recently recognized as Teacher of the Year at McClure\n                     Health Science High School in Gwinnett County. Reflecting on her journey, Ray said graduating from KSU was a testament to the transformative\n                     power of education in her life. \u201cEducation has unlocked countless opportunities and paved the way for a better life,\u201d Ray said. \u201cFrom arriving in a new country with few words to now teaching in English and making a meaningful impact in my school and community is an achievement beyond measure.\u201d Life for Ray has been all but easy. Having arrived in the U.S. on a high school basketball\n                     scholarship at Washington College Academy in Limestone, Tennessee, wartime conflict\n                     abroad prevented her from returning to her home country. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if my family was okay because all the lines were disconnected,\u201d Ray said. \u201cFinally, I got in touch with them. They had been in the basement for several weeks, but they were safe.\u00a0 I was really thankful for that, but it was really hard because I was so young, and I was scared. I was thinking, \u2018What if something happened to my parents over there, what am I going to do?\u2019\u201d Ray later adapted to her new home by becoming fluent in English, navigating college, and, not long after, meeting her first husband. After the relationship turned abusive, Ray found herself in a women\u2019s shelter with her daughter and $5 in her pocket. \u201cAfter that, I decided to go back to school,\u201d Ray said. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in English education at Georgia State University, taking night classes while working as a substitute teacher at an elementary school. Ray would go on to pursue a master\u2019s degree in English education from Mercer University. She also found a new, healthier relationship before ultimately enrolling at KSU.

Varlet and Ford join a robust list of Kennesaw State undergraduates and alumni who\n                     have earned Fulbright scholarships, the primary international educational and cultural\n                     exchange initiative of the U.S. government. \u201cWe are delighted to celebrate the selection of Bon and AKeera to the Fulbright Program,\u201d said Karen Kornweibel, dean of the KSU Journey Honors College . \u201cThe Fulbright Program, established by Congress in 1946, remains the premier international education exchange program operating in over 160 countries worldwide and admits only the top 20% of applicants. Being selected for the Fulbright Study/Research Program reflects a deep commitment to lifelong learning, academic excellence, and creative discovery \u2014 values we proudly cultivate in the KSU Journey Honors College.\u201d Varlet, an Honors student who graduated in May , received the Fulbright Study Award to pursue information security research at KU\n                     Leuven in Belgium. Inspired by a 2023 cyberattack at The British Library, she plans\n                     to explore cybersecurity vulnerabilities in public institutions, particularly libraries,\n                     archives, and research centers. \u201cBecoming a Fulbright Scholar feels like a culminating moment at this stage in my academic career,\u201d said Varlet, who lives in Douglas County. \u201cI had to reload the page because I felt like it wasn\u2019t real. I have never applied to a program like Fulbright before, so having the guidance of Dr. Michelle Miles and the Honors College meant a lot to me.\u201d While studying in KSU\u2019s College of Computing and Software Engineering , Varlet had to put her academic journey briefly on hold while she addressed health\n                     concerns. She later returned to earn a scholarship from VICEROY , a highly competitive program designed to prepare students to undertake cybersecurity\n                     operations for the Department of Defense. \u201cBon\u2019s story is one of creativity, initiative and resilience,\u201d CCSE Dean Sumanth Yenduri said. \u201cAfter taking a break and returning to KSU, she called on her deep desire to learn to grow as a communicator, entrepreneur, public servant, and thought leader in information technology. Bon\u2019s future Fulbright work to protect public institutions from cyber threats is the perfect blend of technical know-how and public good. When we reflect on how computing can make the world better, Bon\u2019s story is an inspiration.\u201d AKeera Ford Ford, who graduated in 2024, also has received a Fulbright Study Award to pursue a\n                     Master of Science in Crime, Justice, and Psychology at the University of Leicester\n                     in the U.K. She plans examine how the U.K.'s victim-centered frameworks promote long-term\n                     recovery, offering insights that could help reimagine the U.S. justice system. \u201cIt feels so validating and encouraging to receive this kind of recognition,\u201d said Ford, a native of Chattanooga, Tennessee. \u201cWhen I opened my award letter I laughed, thanked God, and then cried. The Fulbright process is very competitive, so I am incredibly thankful for this opportunity.\u201d Ford credits KSU\u2019s Office of National and International Scholarships and Fellowships for helping guide her through the application process, giving her the confidence\n                     to prepare and submit her application material. Upon completion of her graduate degree,\n                     she intends to work in the federal government. \u201cAs a Fulbright Scholar, Ms. Ford\u2019s work studying the UK's approach to crime and justice, has the potential to influence how the United States addresses a punitive versus a rehabilitative approach to our national justice system, and perhaps even reducing recidivism,\u201d said Katie Kaukinen, dean of the Radow College of Humanities and Social Sciences . \u201cWe are incredibly proud that Radow College can claim Ms. Ford as our own Fulbright Scholar.\u201d Since 2011, 10 Kennesaw State students and alumni have been named Fulbrighters through\n                     the support of the Office of National and International Scholarships and Fellowships.\n                     Additionally, 21 KSU and Southern Polytechnic State University faculty members have\n                     received Fulbright awards since 1988. \u201cIt is always a decided pleasure to celebrate the success of members of our Kennesaw State University student and alumni community when they are the recipients of prestigious external awards, such as Fulbright grants,\u201d said Miles, director of the Office of National and International Scholarships and Fellowships. \u201cTo have two individuals be named Fulbright Study/Research finalists in the same year is uniquely exciting, as these types of grants are quite limited in number. It is a testament to the caliber of Bon's and AKeera's respective intellectual acumen and project scopes that they were selected.\u201d Students interested in applying for funding opportunities for study abroad, experiential learning, and research are encouraged to contact the\u00a0Office of National and International Scholarships and Fellowships to learn more. \u2013 Story by Travis Highfield Related Stories Triplets each find their own path to success at Kennesaw State Kennesaw State students with Center for Sustainable Journalism hit the ground reporting Kennesaw State student secures prestigious VICEROY Maven internship Research helps dual major forge path at Kennesaw State A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees to its more than 47,000 students.

In his native Northwest Georgia, job growth has outpaced every other region in the state and is expected to continue over the next five years, according to projections from Georgia Power Co. By 2028, Northwest Georgia will add another 43,000 residents, see an increase of 27,000 jobs, and experience an influx of more than $9 billion in capital investment, making the area a critical player in Georgia\u2019s economy. As exciting as this growth is for the region and the state, it comes with some challenges,\n                     the largest of which is a steady talent pipeline. \u201cThe businesses driving Northwest Georgia\u2019s growth need to have access to the right talent,\u201d said Tyler Reinagel, Kennesaw State University\u2019s former associate vice president for economic development. \u201cThat\u2019s where Kennesaw State comes in. We\u2019re making sure that our students are not just prepared for today\u2019s jobs but equipped to be leaders in tomorrow\u2019s industries.\u201d Transforming Georgia\u2019s next frontier Parker has worked for the city of Dalton since he was a high school intern for the\n                     Public Works Department. While he dreamed of a career in music, his experience in\n                     the department and a mentor named Benny Dunn ultimately steered him toward civil engineering\n                     and Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU). \u201cI wanted to do audio and lighting engineering for concerts,\u201d said Parker, who was recently honored among KSU\u2019s 40 Owls Under 40. \u201cBut there was something about Benny; he took me under his wing, and I decided to follow in his footsteps.\u201d After graduating from SPSU, Parker worked for Dunn as a project manager and nine years later succeeded his mentor as the department\u2019s director. In 2021, he was named city administrator overseeing nearly 400 full-time employees and an annual budget of more than $46 million. As city administrator, Parker has worked with Dalton's business and civic leaders to transform the area, known as the \u201cCarpet Capital of the World\u201d due to its status as birthplace of the U.S. carpet industry. Located along the Interstate 75 corridor, Northwest Georgia is composed of 15 counties \u2013 Bartow, Catoosa, Chattooga, Dade, Fannin, Floyd, Gilmer, Gordon, Haralson, Murray, Paulding, Pickens, Polk, Walker, and Whitfield \u2013 and is less than three hours from several major Southeastern cities. Over the past several years, the region has seen explosive growth. A major catalyst has been the Appalachian Regional Port in Murray County, a rail shipping\n                     facility that opened in 2018. Located just a short drive from Dalton and other Northwest\n                     Georgia communities, the facility provides a direct route to the Port of Savannah. \u201cHaving the Appalachian Regional Port just down the road gives companies a real competitive edge,\u201d Parker explained. \u201cIt reduces transit costs and makes locally manufactured products more competitive on the global stage. It's a game-changer for the industry.\u201d Building the talent pipeline Growth throughout the region is creating a demand for a talent pool with diverse skills\n                     and expertise, Reinagel said. In December 2024, the Department of Energy announced a $1.45 billion loan to Qcells, the country\u2019s largest solar manufacturer, to build a supply chain facility in Cartersville. The project will create over 2,800 jobs, including about 1,200 construction jobs. According to the company, nearly half of the construction work has been awarded to local contractors, who are partnering with Kennesaw State to hire recent construction management graduates. Jacqui Riggins In Calhoun, Mohawk Industries is focused on attracting the next generation of professionals to Northwest Georgia, which talent acquisition manager Jacqui Riggins said is critical to the company\u2019s long-term success. \u201cWe manufacture flooring, so most students assume that we\u2019re looking for engineering majors, and that\u2019s certainly true,\u201d said Riggins, a 2020 KSU graduate. \u201cBut as a global leader in flooring with corporate offices in Calhoun, we also need employees in sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and even IT.\u201d Riggins\u2019 oversees the company\u2019s university relations team, which works to attract young talent through internships, leadership development initiatives, and early-career recruitment efforts. Since joining Mohawk in 2021, she has played an instrumental role in growing the company\u2019s internship program, which now includes more than 100 interns from universities across the Southeast. The company has intentionally engaged students at Kennesaw State, which has become\n                     one of its primary partner schools. Riggins and her team regularly connect with the\n                     university through career fairs, resume reviews, mock interviews, and other events.\n                     The goal of these partnerships is student success, and for many KSU graduates, this\n                     collaboration has paid off. Addison Beidleman was one of the 17 KSU students who interned with Mohawk last year. Though she\u2019s always had a passion for the arts, she was drawn to math and science, too. When it came time to pick a major, her practical side felt STEM fields were a better choice. With her mother\u2019s encouragement, however, she found KSU\u2019s Bachelor of Arts in Textile and Surface Design program in the Geer College of the Arts. The program would become the perfect way to pursue her creative passion, while still achieving her other goals. As a bonus, one of Beidleman\u2019s professors in the program worked in Mohawk\u2019s design department and helped her secure an internship with the company. \u201cI know it sounds weird, but listening to her got me really excited about a career in flooring,\u201d Beidleman said. \u201cYou\u2019re working with different patterns and designs so you can be creative while making something that\u2019s useful.\u201d While interning with the commercial design team, Beidleman\u2019s design work \u2013 particularly in creating carpet for senior living spaces \u2013 was so successful that it became part of the company\u2019s product collection. After graduating last December, she was offered a full-time position as a design associate. Mark Page, vice president of design for Mohawk, values the connection between the\n                     company and KSU, where he serves as an advisor in the Geer College of the Arts. \"Mohawk has built a wonderful relationship with the KSU School of Art and Design and their growing textiles program,\" Page said. \"Together, we\u2019ve created internship and employment opportunities for student textiles and surface designers.\u201d Connecting academia and industry Reinagel says that the more these companies engage with and hire Kennesaw State students,\n                     the more they are exposed to the breadth of talent, innovation, and research the university\n                     has to offer. Graduate students in Kennesaw State\u2019s analytics and data science program helped another giant in the flooring industry and longtime KSU supporter Shaw Industries find solutions to improve the customer experience. \u201cIt\u2019s beneficial for our students to work on industry projects and visit companies,\u201d Reinagel said. \u201cIt\u2019s equally as important for us to open our doors and invite industry leaders to visit campus, to engage with the university, its faculty researchers and students, and to see first-hand the resources available to them.\u201d Recently, executives from Shaw visited campus to meet with Karin Scarpinato, KSU\u2019s vice president for research, as well as deans and faculty to discuss partnership opportunities. Students also had the chance to talk with and learn more about potential opportunities with Shaw. Similarly, the university hosted \u201cManufacturing Day,\u201d where leaders from multiple industries met with researchers and other faculty and administrators to discuss trends and the challenges they are facing as they look to the future. Leaders with companies in the northwest region have also been engaging on a more individual basis with the university. Shaila Bettadapur, Mohawk\u2019s treasurer and vice president for corporate relations, serves as a KSU Foundation Trustee. Dalton native and successful entrepreneur Brett White serves as a member of the Kennesaw State University Athletics Association. White and his wife Lesha made a $1 million gift that supported the soon to be opened Mickey Dunn baseball stadium. He also is a partner in White Capital Group LLC, a family-owned investment company, as well as president of the White Family Foundation, which concentrates on philanthropic efforts scholarships, religion, arts, and athletics. Other executives with Northwest Georgia companies serve on several college and department industry advisory boards providing support and guidance while promoting collaborative relationships. \u201cAs Northwest Georgia continues to grow, KSU\u2019s role in shaping its future will only become more important by developing talent, conducting impactful research, and engaging in high-impact partnerships,\u201d Reinagel said.

His work aims to deepen our understanding of how to generate\n                     and stabilize topological out-of-equilibrium quantum states. Topological states of matter are quantum phases that remain stable even in the presence\n                     of non-ideal conditions such as material disorder. They arise in complex materials\n                     and can also be created using tailored light. These states enable unique electrical\n                     and magnetic properties, with promising applications in quantum computing, advanced\n                     communications, and medical imaging. Asmar\u2019s research advances the discovery of novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states by harnessing periodic modulations in quantum materials. Moving beyond uniform light exposure, his work explores the largely uncharted realm of light interacting with inhomogeneous materials to access previously unreachable quantum phases. By accounting for temperature effects and electron collisions, the project will deliver\n                     accurate, experimentally relevant predictions for controlling matter with structured\n                     fields. These insights will impact light-irradiated systems, strain engineering and\n                     open-system dynamics, offering a roadmap for experiments and future breakthroughs\n                     in quantum materials. \u201cThis grant significantly expands research opportunities for KSU students,\u201d said Asmar, assistant professor of physics . \u201cThey\u2019ll be directly involved in the rapidly evolving field of theoretical condensed matter physics, positioning KSU at the forefront of innovation in quantum science and technology.\u201d With support from the grant, Asmar\u2019s research will combine rigorous mathematical modeling and advanced simulations to uncover how light alters the properties of quantum materials. As a theoretical physicist, he predicts material behavior under complex light exposure, providing a powerful framework to guide experiments and enable precise control of quantum systems. Asmar earned a grant from the National Science Foundation in 2022 to study interactions between light and matter while introducing undergraduates and\n                     community members to this area of condensed matter physics. \u201cMy NSF grant led to key breakthroughs, including proof that vortex-like states can be generated in matter through light,\u201d Asmar said. \u201cThose results were instrumental in securing this Department of Energy grant. The work we\u2019re undertaking now will lay the foundation for the research we will carry forward here at KSU.\u201d Asmar collaborates with Nancy Sandler, a professor of physics at Ohio University,\n                     where Asmar received his doctorate in 2015. The grant will help continue that collaboration,\n                     funding a graduate student there as well as a summer internship for undergraduate\n                     and graduate researchers. The grant will also fund a postdoctoral scholar as well\n                     as two undergraduate researchers at KSU. In a banner year for KSU\u2019s Department of Physics, Asmar\u2019s recent Department of Energy grant adds to a series of major faculty achievements. In August 2024, professors Marco Guzzi and Nikolaos Kidonakis secured a $360,000 NSF grant for their work in theoretical particle physics at CERN. Earlier this year, associate\n                     professor Chetan Dhital and assistant professor of chemistry Madalynn Marshall received a $799,934 DOE grant to study magnetic materials and emerging technologies. Physics students also made significant strides. Junior Casey Hampson conducted NSF-funded summer research at CERN , and junior Emily Manqueros earned top honors at the Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium , the first physics student to do so in the event\u2019s 11-year history. Siam Sarower\u2014a junior physics major and mentee of Asmar\u2014earned two of the highest national honors for undergraduate scientists. In March, he became the first KSU physics student to receive the Barry Goldwater Scholarship , the most prestigious undergraduate award in STEM, for his research on space-time modulation in graphene. In May, he was named a student ambassador of the American Physical Society, reflecting both KSU\u2019s outstanding research and growing leadership in the national physics community. \u201cThe grant that Dr. Asmar has secured from the Department of Energy is yet another feather in the cap of the stellar recent performance of CSM\u2019s Physics Department,\u201d said Heather Koopman, dean of KSU\u2019s College of Science and Mathematics .\u00a0\u201cWe have world-class researchers, along with incredible undergraduate students doing research and winning awards \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect combination that is exactly in tune with CSM\u2019s aim of achieving national prominence in Undergraduate Research.\u201d The grant was one of 40 awarded nationally by the Department of Energy, totaling $31\n                     million. \u2013 Story by Dave Shelles Related Stories Triplets each find their own path to success at Kennesaw State KSU Game Studio levels up with new release Research helps dual major forge path at Kennesaw State Kennesaw State alum receives international scientific honor A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees to its more than 47,000 students.
